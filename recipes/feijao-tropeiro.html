        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The feijão tropeiro is from the time of Brazil Colony, when the tropeiros, those men who walked with their troops, guiding animals, took goods throughout the country. Their diet consisted basically of beans, bacon, flour, black pepper, cornmeal and Coité (a kind of vinegar sauce with some squeezed fruits). 
            In their stops, they ate the beans almost without broth, sun meat with a farofa and chopped cabbage. And this food, which at the time was constant, even for lack of option, became our famous common bean, taking the name of its main tasters, which until today is successful and became even better.
